# Welcome to Viciniti, Ryan! 🚀

This guide will help you get set up so you can start building features with me. Don't worry if you aren't a "tech expert"—Antigravity (your AI assistant) will do most of the heavy lifting.

## 1. Things to Install (The "Toolbox")

Please download and install these three things on your computer:

1. **Git**: [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win). *In short, Git is a system that keeps a history of every change we make so we never lose work and can collaborate easily.*
2. **Antigravity**: [Download here](https://codeium.com/download). This is your AI assistant that will help you write code and build features.
3. **Android Studio**: [Download here](https://developer.android.com/studio). We need this to run the "Android Emulator" (a virtual phone on your screen).
    * *Setup Tip*: After installing, open it, go to **Tools** -> **Device Manager**, and click **"Create Device"** to set up a virtual phone (like a Pixel 7).

## 2. Setting up Antigravity

1. Open **Antigravity**.
2. Open the **viciniti** folder (the project folder).
3. Look for the **Antigravity icon** in the sidebar (it looks like a little robot or a sparkle).
4. Open the chat panel. This is where you and the AI work together!

## 3. Helpful Extensions (The "Add-ons")

To make things even easier, you can install these "extensions" inside Antigravity (click the square icon in the sidebar that looks like building blocks):

* **Markdown Preview**: Once this is installed, you can **Right-click** on this `README_RYAN.md` file in the sidebar and click **"Open Preview"**. It will turn this text file into a beautiful, easy-to-read document!
* **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets**: This helps the AI (and you) write mobile code faster.

## 4. Your Workflow (How to Build Features)

You can do **everything** from the chat window on the right. Antigravity can write code, run the app, and handle all the Git stuff for you.

### Step 1: Explain what you want

In the Antigravity chat, just type what you want to do in plain English.

**Pro Tips for the Chat:**

* **Model**: Make sure to use **"Gemini 3 Flash"** for the best experience.
* **Modes**: Use **"Fast"** mode for quick questions or minor changes. Change to **"Planning"** mode when you want to build a larger new feature.

* *Example*: "I want to change the color of the 'Join' button to green" or "I want to add a new screen for user settings."

### Step 2: Let the AI work

Antigravity will analyze the code and make the changes for you.

### Step 3: View your changes

Once the AI is done, you want to see if it looks right! Just ask:
> *"Can you launch the Android Emulator so I can see the changes?"*
(Or, you can manually type `npm run android` in the Antigravity terminal).

## 5. Saving Your Work (The "PR")

When you are happy with your changes, you need to "propose" them to the team. This is called a **Pull Request (PR)**.

**What is a PR?**
Think of a PR as a **proposal**. Instead of just overwriting the main code, you are saying: *"Hey, I made these changes, here is why they are good. Can you review and add them to the official app?"*

**How to do it:**
Just ask Antigravity in the chat:
> *"I'm done with these changes. Can you create a PR for me called 'Update Join Button Color'?"*

**Happy Coding!** If you get stuck, just ask Antigravity: *"I am stuck on Step X, can you help me?"*
